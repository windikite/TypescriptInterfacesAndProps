My 52nd assignment! We further explore tsx here and utilize both interfaces and props.  

Assignment 1  
I definded an interface for users and then used it to create a currentUser variable. Then, I implemented a component that would receive those props checked against the same interface, rendering it afterwards.  

Assignment 2  
I created a reusable card component that would render a prop passed from the parent as a child of the card. It is checked against an interface that will accept any valid jsx content. By passing in elements, you can wrap them in a formatted card and easily add style customization as well, such as bolding all text within it.
